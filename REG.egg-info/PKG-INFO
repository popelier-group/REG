# REG.py
This repository is a continuation of the development of the Relative Energy Gradient (REG) method [[1]](#1) implemented in Python3.

The manual.pdf contains the information regarding the theory and the code implementation plus a full walk-through tutorial on a simple system.  

Please, report bugs and issues to fabio.falcioni@manchester.ac.uk

Please, cite [[1]](#1) if using this code for your studies/research. The code is under MIT license.
# Dependencies
- [AdjustText](https://github.com/Phlya/adjustText)
- [xlsxwriter](https://github.com/jmcnamara/XlsxWriter)
# Setup
The `setup_rdp.py` is a standalone script that can be run with specific options to find the suitable number of points on which to run the following REG-IQA analysis.
It uses the Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm [[2]](#2) on the PES obtained from electronic structure calculations. 
Run the command
 `python3 setup_rdp.py -h (or --help)`
 for the usage. 
 
Minimum requirements:
 -  A txt file containing the energies at each step of an IRC or PES scan (easily obtained in GaussView).
# Usage
***Manual has been update with a full tutorial. Functions section needs to be updated***

To run a REG analysis (with IQA and DFT-D3):
- Save this repository in your machine.
- Copy the `auto_reg.py` script in the folder where each REG step has been saved. Note: Each REG step should be saved as a numbered folder and contain the gaussian single point energy output, gaussian wavefunction output and the atomic-files folder obtained with AIMAll [[3]](#3). 
- Enter the script, change the REG installation path and all the possible options as explained in the script.
- Run the command : 
`python3 auto_reg.py > reg.log &`
  
# Results
All results of the REG analysis will be saved in a folder called "SYSTEM_results" with SYSTEM being the chosen system name. 
Inside the folder different files for each type of energy will be found together with png images of the REG tables and various csv files for later data analysis.
The main file is called "REG.xlsx" which contains all the results together in one place.
